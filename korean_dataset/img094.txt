Image of a close-up urban scene looking up at a tall vertical white sign with bold red Korean text "세탁" and a thin light blue stripe at the top. The sign is next to a dark gray concrete utility pole on the left. Tangled black and gray wires stretch across the image, connecting to the pole and a reddish-brown brick building on the right. The building shows weathered metal components and a portion of an outdoor unit. A red scalloped tiled roof is visible behind the pole. The background is a bright white sky.
