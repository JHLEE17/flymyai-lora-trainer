Image of a rustic vertical white sign board with bold brush stroke black Korean characters "지리산" at its center. Above the text are stylized dark brown mountain shapes and light grey cloud elements. The sign is framed on the left by a light grey concrete block wall and on the right by a rough reddish brown tree trunk and a darker concrete column. Dry branches and dark ground cover are visible at the bottom.
