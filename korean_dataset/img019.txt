Image of a vertical shot of a brick wall at night. Three large, bold, silver-gray signs with glowing white outlines are stacked vertically slightly to the left. The top sign is 'G', the middle is 'S', and the bottom is the Korean character "ë¹Œ". The brick wall features various shades of brown, beige, and dark gray. Warm light illuminates the signs and parts of the wall, casting prominent shadows. A small dark circular object is on the upper right.
