Above the main text are rows of small red blue green and white LED lights. Below the main text smaller blue numbers T.385-1009 and black Korean text "(주)해피온누리이엘 온누리전광판" are visible on a lighter strip. A white rectangular outdoor light fixture is mounted below this strip. The background shows parts of a blue modern building and grey concrete with black power lines crossing the upper left. The image is a realistic clear and well lit photograph.
