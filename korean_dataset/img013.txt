Image of a weathered yellow rectangular sign prominently placed in the center of the frame, tilted slightly right. The sign has black Korean text "화성" at the top and distressed pink Korean text "세" and "탁소" below. The yellow paint is cracked and peeling, with some rust visible on its top metal frame. To the left of the sign is a worn brown brick sidewalk with a faded white painted line running diagonally. To the right is a grey concrete curb leading to dark grey asphalt road, with a metal storm drain grate visible and a yellow painted line on the asphalt. The composition is a high angle view looking down at the ground level.
