Image of a vibrant photorealistic botanical garden sign. The composition features a rich display of red, yellow, and purple tulips with green grass and foliage. Large central Korean text in light brown with a white outline reads "양평 들꽃 수목원", overlaid on a subtle light green abstract floral shape. Smaller white Korean text with a black outline "양평" is positioned on the left. A white rectangular banner states "Wild Flower Botanical Garden" with a small arrow. At the top, the lower legs of a person wearing white sneakers and light pants are visible on the green grass. A faint light green bird silhouette is placed above the red tulips.
