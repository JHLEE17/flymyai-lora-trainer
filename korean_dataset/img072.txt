Image of a grainy urban photograph featuring a large, rectangular white sign with bold dark red Korean characters "오야". The sign is mounted on a light brown brick wall, positioned in the center right of the frame, angled slightly toward the viewer. To the left, a dark window or glass surface reveals faint, blurry numbers like 9 and 8. The overall style is realistic with visible film grain, muted colors, and a low light atmosphere.
