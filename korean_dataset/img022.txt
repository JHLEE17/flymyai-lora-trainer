Image of a close up of a weathered vertical Korean street sign. The sign is primarily teal green with large white Korean characters "세탁". Above this is a pale yellow band with partial blue Korean text "도". White trim on the sign shows peeling paint. To the left, a sliver of another similar sign is visible, revealing dark red bricks and a concrete structure through a narrow gap. To the right, dark green tree foliage and a bright white sky are visible. Realistic street photography style.
