Image of a weathered dark gray hair salon sign viewed from a low angle against a cloudy sky. The sign prominently features large white Korean text "헤어아트", a red horizontal stripe with white text "CUT COLOR PERM CLINIC" separated by small dots, and small white numbers "T.2.4.2.8.1.3.5". On the far left, there is a decorative light gray swirl with white dots. Two dark industrial spotlights extend upwards from the sign's top edge. A second partially visible sign to the right has green and white sections with vertical Korean text "미용실". The bottom of the main sign reveals a rough, dark brown and gray building structure.
