Image of a modern minimalist sign featuring large, brushed silver metallic Korean characters "설악산" mounted on a dark charcoal gray wall. To the upper right of the characters, there is a bright irregular orange-red plaque with black text "SINCE 1961" in a casual handwritten style. The elements are three dimensional and cast subtle shadows on the wall. A vertical strip of warm distressed brown wood paneling frames the right edge of the dark gray wall.
