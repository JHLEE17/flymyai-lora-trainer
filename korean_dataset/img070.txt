Image of a signboard for a Korean restaurant with large, stylized typography. The sign features an off-white, vertically textured background. The prominent Korean characters "황" in dark brown, "후" in vibrant red-orange, and "명가" in dark brown are centered. A golden-yellow traditional pattern runs along the left edge. A red-orange decorative swirl is positioned above the red "후" character. Below the main text, "Korean Restaurant" is written in dark brown. In the bottom right, small Chinese characters "皇后雞湯" are on a red oval. The sign is mounted below a weathered light cream building wall, showing a white metal window grate and a light grey drainage pipe above.
