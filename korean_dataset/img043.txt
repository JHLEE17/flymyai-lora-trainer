Image of a vertical freestanding sign with a vibrant yellow panel and prominent black Korean text "송춘서점". The sign is framed by a dark brown worn border. To the left of the sign is a textured light beige wall with horizontal grout lines. To the right is a darker, bluish-gray textured wall, also with horizontal lines, exhibiting a faint shadow from the sign. The ground below the sign and walls is a dark tiled surface. The composition is a close up of the sign against the walls, depicted in a realistic photographic style under low artificial light.
